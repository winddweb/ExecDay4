1.
git reset (soft hard or mixed) moves the head back, and may also remove the changes you made. git revert creates a series of new commits that reverse the actions you did. Soft keeps the staged changes, mixed makes them unstaged. 

2.
Merge will create a new commit and merges the changes. Rebase will re-apply the changes with new commits to the base.
